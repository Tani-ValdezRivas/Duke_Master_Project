This master's project examined and characterized temporal patterns from pile-driving and sound exposure level changes at Vineyard Wind 1, the first commercial- scale offshore wind farm in the United States. Collaborating with Project WOW, a trans-disciplinary, highly integrated collaboration of diverse experts for the comprehensive evaluation of the potential effects of offshore wind energy development on marine wildlife, I examined Six “Rockhopper” recording units (Cornell University; https://www.birds.cornell.edu/ccb/rockhopper-unit/) that deployed within and surrounding the Vineyard Wind 1 Wind Energy Area (WEA) from August 15th, 2023 to February 13th, 2024.

I used Raven Pro, an acoustic software program designed to visualize, measure, and analyze sounds (https://www.ravensoundsoftware.com/software/raven-pro/), to calculate the number and duration of pile-driving strikes recorded on the five Rockhoppers deployed within or surrounding the Vineyard Wind 1 WEA. An automated pile-driving strike detector algorithm was created in Raven Pro for Rockhoppers closest to turbine installation. 

For each strike, the following parameters were measured on Raven Pro:
- The Sound Exposure Level (SEL), which measures the energy of a pulse, defined as the squared instantaneous sound pressure integrated over the pulse duration (dB re 1 μPa2-s)
- The 5% and 95% of the total pulse energy

Using R, I calculated the duration of the piling event, the average inter-pulse between each strike and between each continuous piling period, the strike rate, the average pulse duration, and duty cycle. Additionally, I found the SEL for nearest and farthest Rockhoppers for these days to compare changes in sound levels.

Please note, the coding for this project is not being released to the public. 

This Master's project submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Environmental Management degree in the Nicholas School of the Environment of Duke University.
